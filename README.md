# Speech-in-Noise Psychometric Function
The current version of this web app can be found at [http://www.indiana.edu/~ahslab/uml/#/](http://www.indiana.edu/~ahslab/uml/#/).

The purpose of this application is to help test the patients' hearing ability,
based on the Speech-in-Noise Psychometric Function.
The traditional procedures for testing how well a patient can hear takes a lot of time.
Our goal is to reduce the time it takes to test patients' hearing ability.
