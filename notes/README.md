**Goals**

The main objective is to refactor the code to take advantage
of great frameworks like AngularJS to reduce complexity.
Another goal is to redesign the view to improve how it looks to the user.

**To Do**

- [x] Port to AngularJS
- [x] Write unit tests with [Karma and Jasmine](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/unit-testing)
- [x] Create documentation
- [ ] Redesign the view using [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- [ ] Deploy

**Problems**

Device compatibility might be an issue when we start considering
how the canvas would look like on small devices. 

**Documentation**

Documentation has not yet been generated.
