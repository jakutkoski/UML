**Goals**

The main objective is to refactor the code to take advantage
of great frameworks like AngularJS to reduce complexity.
Another goal is to redesign the view to improve how it looks to the user.

**To Do**

- [x] Port to AngularJS and Bootstrap using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
- [x] Write unit tests with [Jasmine](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/unit-testing)
- [ ] Create documentation

**Problems**

The Graph tab doesn't update on some versions of Internet Explorer.
We have added a note to the user to use the latest version of
Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.

**Documentation**

Documentation has not yet been made.
